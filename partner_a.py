# MSDS 501 – Day 2 Exercise  |  Partner A
# ============================================================
# SCENARIO: A sensor logs daily temperature readings as strings.
# Some readings are corrupt (non-numeric). The script tries to
# convert every reading to a float so we can compute the average.
#
# YOUR TASK (Task 2): Run this script and read the error.
#   - What type of error is it?
#   - Which line causes it?
#   - Write a comment below explaining the cause.
#
# YOUR TASK (Task 3): Wrap the risky conversion in try/except.
#   - Catch the specific error type (not bare except:)
#   - When a bad value is caught, print a message that includes
#     the index and the bad value — e.g.:
#         [index 3] Skipped bad reading: 'N/A'
#   - The script should complete without crashing.
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUT (after your fix):
#   Reading [0]: 72.1
#   Reading [1]: 68.5
#   [index 2] Skipped bad reading: 'N/A'
#   Reading [3]: 74.0
#   [index 4] Skipped bad reading: 'sensor_error'
#   Reading [5]: 69.3
#   Average of valid readings: 70.98
# ============================================================

    try:

        print(f'Reading [{i}]: {temp}')
        valid.append(temp)
    except ValueError: #this ValueError catches the ValueError and prevents the code from crashing
        print (f" Reading [{i}] is not an integer:{r}") #this will print the index and tell the user why the ValueError was raised
